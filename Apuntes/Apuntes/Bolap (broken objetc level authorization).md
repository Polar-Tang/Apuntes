Attackers can exploit API endpoints that are vulnerable to broken object level authorization by manipulating the ID of an object that is sent within the request. This may lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data. This issue is extremely common in API-based applications because the server component usually does not fully track the clientâ€™s state, and instead, relies more on parameters like object IDs, that are sent from the client to decide which objects to access.
